<h2>An Analysis of Can Single Neurons Solve MNIST? The

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The paper investigates the ability of a neural network architecture inspired by the dendritic functionality of biological neurons in solving image classification
problems. Typical artificial neural network architecture involves linearly summing a set of inputs before applying a nonlinear threshhold. This is different from 
how biological neurons function. The dendrites of biological neurons introduce nonlinearities to synaptic inputs before summation at the soma. The authors of the paper 
created a neural network model that better approximates the behavior of biological neurons and trained and tested it on multiple image classification datasets. A flaw of 
authors' model is that the weights of the model can be postive or negative. In true biological neurons the weights can only be positive. In this project, we modify the 
model so that it constrains the values of the weights to only be positive. </p>

<h2>Literature Review; Biography; Social Impact; Industry Applications; Follow-on Research; and Peer-Review</h2>

<p>Just as we have done in the role-playing exercise, analyze the paper from all perspectives.
</p>

<p>Optionally, in addition to a reading-based analysis, implement the ideas of the paper in code, and report on your findings.
</p>

<h2>Technical Structure</h2>

<p>We replicated the authors’ model architecture, using a k-tree model to be a feed forward neural network with sparse binary-tree connections. We sparsified the 
 weight matrices by having each node receive 2 inputs and producing 1 output. The final layer of this tree is k by 1, k being the number of subtrees in the k-tree. 
 We used a “freeze mask” that records which weights are set to 0 in order to freeze 0-weights during training. Additionally, we used a sigmoid non-linearity at the 
 final output node which keeps output values between 0 and 1, and we used a leaky ReLU with a 0.01 slope for nodes between layers.
</p>

<p>In attempts to make a more biologically-inspired neural network, we constrained the values of the weights to only be positive. We did this by applying an absolute
 value function during the standard “Kaiming normal” weight initialization. Additionally, during training, we clamp the values to be non-negative. We plan to make
 the model more biologically plausible by constraining these values to be scalar.
